== Screen Share

A simple sinatra app to share your computer screen with others.

= Uses

This is perfect for conferences with "less than perfect" projectors and/or large rooms. Presenters can just fire this app up and then anyone in the audience can see full resolution slides on their computers. 

= Limitations

Currently this is OS X only (server side) as it relies on screencapture. 

There also seems to be a problem with Safari 4+ and jquery.imagefit
